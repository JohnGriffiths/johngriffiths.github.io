title: New paper in Nature
tags: neuroscience

We've just published [*Fully integrated silicon probes for high-density recording of neural activity*](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature24636) in Nature. The paper (signed by 35 authors) describes the results of a large research project involving the Allen Institute, University College London, HHMI's Janelia Research Campus, and imec, a nanoelectronics research center in Belgium.

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

The goal of the project was to design and create a new silicon probe, called Neuropixels, for large-scale in-vivo extracellular recordings (384 channels). Tested in awake, behaving mice, the spiking activity of hundreds of neurons could be recorded simultaneously.
