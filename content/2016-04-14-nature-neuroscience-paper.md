tags: neuroscience

We published a [new paper in Nature Neuroscience](http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v19/n4/full/nn.4268.html) about our spike sorting method. This paper is accompanied by an open source software suite named [klusta](http://klusta.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), which includes automatic and manual programs for extracting spikes from large multielectrode recordings.
